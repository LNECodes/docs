Merchants can use Stripeâ€™s payment management system with Loop to collect onchain payments for one-time purchases, subscriptions and invoices.

Merchants manage their billing logic (including coupon codes, free trials, charging per API, etc), product creation, and subscription management within Stripe. Thus, merchants can use the same logic regardless of whether their customers have chosen to pay with fiat or on.

### Why Loop + Stripe?

While Stripe offers crypto payment processing, it has limitations on who can use it and what features are available which may not meet many merchants' needs. This is where a specialized crypto and stablecoin payment gateway like Loop Crypto comes in. You can continue using Stripe for core billing logic and invoice generation while Loop supplements the platform with a more robust crypto payment solution that integrates seamlessly with Stripe.

Loop provides a Typescript SDK to easy integration with various payment and payout functionalities, including webhooks, token management, merchants, entities, and customers.

We use the [**semantic versioning standard**](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/versioning#stripe-sdk-versions) for SDKs, and [**version APIs**](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/versioning#stripe-api-versions) by release date. Breaking API changes increase the SDKâ€™s major version.

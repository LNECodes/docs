## **Setting Up Your Wallet**

**Install MetaMask** - This is the most beginner-friendly wallet for Ethereum networks. Go to [<u>metamask.io</u>](http://metamask.io) and install the browser extension or mobile app. Create a new wallet and securely store your seed phrase (write it down offline and keep it safe). Make sure you have the Metamask browser extension pinned for easy use.

**Add Sepolia Testnet** - In MetaMask, click the network dropdown at the top left and search for Sepolia under test networks. Toogle turn test networks on.

## **Getting Test ETH**

**Use a Sepolia Faucet** - Visit faucets like [sepolia-faucet.pk910.de](http://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de) or [faucets.chain.link](http://faucets.chain.link). You'll need to connect your wallet and request test ETH.

**Alternative Faucets** - If one doesn't work, try Alchemy's faucet (requires creating a free account) or Infura's faucet. These services often have daily limits, so you might need to wait between requests.

## **Getting Test USDC**

**USDC Faucet** - Circle offers a [<u>USDC faucet</u>](https://faucet.circle.com/). Make sure you select the Sepolia network.

**Add USDC Token** - If you do not see the USDC show up in your wallet after a few minutes, you may need to add in the USDC token to MetaMask. To do this, in MetaMask, under the "tokens" tab, click the "more" icon to see "+Import tokens." Paste the USDC contract address `0x1c7d4b196cb0c7b01d743fbc6116a902379c7238`, and the token symbol and decimals should auto-populate.

## **Important Reminders**

**Never use real money** - Testnet tokens have no real value and are only for testing and learning.

**Keep your seed phrase secure** - This is your only way to recover your wallet if you lose access. The address you made will work on mainnet accounts that can hold tokens with value.

**Double-check networks** - Always verify you're on the correct testnet before making transactions.

**Gas fees** - You'll need some test ETH to pay for transaction fees (gas) when moving tokens around.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Create your Loop entity which defines your payment acceptance criteria and settlement preferences.

    When you create your entity, you will define: 

    1. `paymentTypes`: Which tokens and networks you'll accept
    2. `payoutDestinations`: Where payments should be sent per network

    When defining the `payoutDestinations`, you’ll choose if settlement is to your crypto wallet or to your bank account (fiat offramping). You’ll need to make this choice for each network.

    If you select fiat, Loop will create wallets for you to receive crypto and off-ramp every 24 hours to your linked bank account. Loop can also swap from crypto (e.g. ETH, SOL) to a stablecoin when it's received, so as to hedge any price volatility. Receiving fiat requires KYB and incurs an additional offramp fee. We can off-ramp to over 44 countries and currencies.

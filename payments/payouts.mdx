description: "Settle in fiat or crypto "

When creating an entity the `payoutDestination` is a required field that defines where funds settle - either a wallet address for crypto settlement or a bank account for fiat settlement. You must have a payout destination and payment types configured to receive payment on a network.

#### **Information to know**

- Payout destinations are configured per network, allowing you to choose between fiat or crypto settlement on each supported network.
- Please check our fiat settlement documentation for supported networks and tokens, as not all networks and tokens are available for off-ramping.

## **Crypto Settlement**

For crypto settlement, simply specify per network:

`settlementType: crypto`\
`walletAddress`: The blockchain wallet address where payments will be sent (must be a valid address for the specified network)

That's all that's required for crypto settlement

## **Fiat Settlement**

Loop's off-ramping process is designed to be completely automated once initial setup is complete:

- **Setup**: Merchant completes KYC/KYB verification and provides bank account information
- **Wallet Creation**: Loop automatically creates a dedicated wallet that is permanently linked to the merchant's bank account
- **Automatic Sweeping**: Every 24 hours, all funds are swept from the merchant's wallet and automatically converted to fiat
- **Bank Transfer**: Converted funds are immediately transferred to the linked bank account

This process requires no merchant intervention once configured. Manual off-ramp initiation is also available upon request for merchants who prefer more control over timing.

### **Merchant Creation and Configuration**

#### **Creating the Merchant**

- Create a merchant in Loop and configure `settlementType: fiat`
- Payout destinations are configured per network

Pass the `fiatSettlementSettings` object to initiate the KYB verification process.

- **Entity type**: Business or individual
- **Name**: Required field for individuals (provide their legal name)
- **Email**: Optional field, defaults to the merchant's email address if not provided

#### **API Response**

Upon successful merchant creation, you'll receive:

- **kycLink**: Direct link to the KYC/B documentation process. Merchants must complete this for off-ramp functionality to be enabled
- **bankAccountFormLink**: External link to the bank account setup form. Redirect users to this link to add their banking information.

Additionally, Loop will automatically create a wallet where crypto is sent to for off-ramping

### **Status Monitoring**

Use the GET merchant endpoint to query KYC/KYB status:

- **Pending**: Documentation under review
- **Approved**: Ready for off-ramping
- **Rejected**: Additional documentation or corrections required

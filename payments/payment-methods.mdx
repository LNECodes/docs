The `paymentMethod` defines the `walletAddress`, `network` and `token`combination a User pays a Merchant with.

A payment method can be utilized to take payments without requiring the User to connect with wallet again by passing the`paymentMethodId` into the <u>payin request</u>.

Currently payers can only have 1 default payment method, but can have many payment methods on file. Merchants can optionally choose which payment method they want to charge and Users.

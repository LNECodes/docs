| paymentTypes           | Defines the tokens and networks that your entity is willing to support. <br /><br />For ease, you can pass in the `tokenSymbols` like `USDC` and `USDT` instead of passing in their `tokenAddresses`. The List Tokens endpoint will tell you the available tokens and networks to chose from. If you do not see a network or token that you would like, please contact Loop.<br /><br />For each network, you will need to define where funds will be paid out. This can either be in fiat or crypto. |
| fiatSettlementSettings | If you chose to settle in fiat, you will need to pass in this object to set up your KYB process. <br /><br />The API call will respond with: <br /><br />**kycLink**: Direct link to the KYC/B documentation process. Merchants must complete this for off-ramp functionality to be enabled  **bankAccountFormLink**: External link to the bank account setup form. Redirect users to this link to add their banking information.                                                                     |

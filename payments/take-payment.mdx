## Configure the pay component

The `config` prop is central attribute that controls what the component will look like and what functionality is available. Passing in the `merchantId` is how the Pay component knows what payment types to display.

The context configuration attribute defines which functionality will be available within the component. Use the `connectAndPay`configuration.

We have a [<u>demo page</u>](https://connect.loopcrypto.xyz/) to help with integration and testing.

| paymentTypes   | Defines the tokens and networks that your entity is willing to support. <br /><br />For ease, you can pass in the `tokenSymbols` like `USDC` and `USDT` instead of passing in their `tokenAddresses`. The List Tokens endpoint will tell you the available tokens and networks to chose from. If you do not see a network or token that you would like, please contact Loop.<br /><br />For each network, you will need to define where funds will be paid out. This can either be in fiat or crypto. |

## Configuring Payment Types

The `paymentTypes` parameter defines which tokens and networks your entity will support.

**Token specification:**

- Use `tokenSymbols` (e.g., `USDC`, `USDT`) for simplified configuration
- Alternatively, specify `tokenAddresses` for precise token identification
- View available tokens and networks using the List Tokens endpoint
- Contact Loop to request support for additional networks or tokens

**Network configuration:** For each network, you must define a payout destination specifying either crypto or fiat settlement.

## Settlement Options

### Crypto Wallet Settlement

Payments are sent directly to your designated cryptocurrency wallet address.

### Fiat Off-ramping

Payments are converted to fiat currency and deposited to your linked bank account.

**Configuration:** Pass the `fiatSettlementSettings` object to initiate the KYB verification process.

**API Response:** The entity creation response will include:

- `kycLink`: Direct link to the KYC/KYB documentation process. Merchants must complete this before off-ramp functionality is enabled
- `bankAccountFormLink`: External link to the bank account setup form. Redirect users here to add their banking information

**How it works:**

- Loop automatically provisions wallets to receive crypto on your behalf
- Received funds are off-ramped to your linked bank account at set thresholds (time or value) 
- Optionally enable automatic conversion from crypto to stablecoins 

**Requirements:**

- Complete Know Your Business (KYB) verification via the provided `kycLink`
- Link a bank account using the `bankAccountFormLink`

**Fees:**

- Additional off-ramp fees apply to fiat settlements based on off-ramp currency and country

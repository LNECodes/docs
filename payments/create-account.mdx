| `paymentTypes` | Defines the tokens and networks that your entity is willing to support. <br /><br />For ease, you can pass in the `tokenSymbols` like `USDC` and `USDT` instead of passing in their `tokenAddresses`. The List Tokens endpoint will tell you the available tokens and networks to chose from. If you do not see a network or token that you would like, please contact Loop.<br /><br />For each network, you will need to define where funds will be paid out. This can either be in fiat or crypto. |

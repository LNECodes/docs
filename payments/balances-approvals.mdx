title: "Balances and authorization "
---

Unlike other payment methods, you can check the balance and authorization amount of a wallet at any time by calling the `paymentMethods` endpoint. The response will include:

```json
"preAuthorization": {
        "balance": "2000.802177",
        "authorization": "100000.01"
  }
```

The balance amount is in the `token` amount and pre-formatted for token decimals. For stablecoins, like USDC and USDT, the token amount is equal to \$1. 

For all other tokens, you will can use the decimals and exchange rate provided in the response to convert.

```json
 "decimals": 6,
        "exchangeRates": [
          {
            "currency": "USD",
            "price": "10000",
            "provider": "Loop",
            "timestamp": 1760629472
          }
```

You can use this information to:

- Send proactive notifications (like emails) to customers before payments are due
- Check the status of a payment method before charging it
- Understand why a payment is not processing

#### **Handling insufficient token balance**

It is up to the end User to add more money to their wallet. 

#### **Handling insufficient authorization**

While the Pay component prompts the User to set a high enough authorization to cover future payments, this amount is consumed as payment occurs onchain. Thus, a may User need to increase their authorization. This functionality is a core feature of blockchains and cannot be overridden by Loop.

If a User needs to increase their authorization, you can use the Manage Widget to provide a place for Users to easily adjust their authorization amount.

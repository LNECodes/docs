title: "Balances and authorization "
---

Unlike other payment methods, you can check the balance and authorization amount of a wallet at any time by calling the `paymentMethods` endpoint. The response will include:

```json
"preAuthorization": {
        "balance": "2000.802177",
        "authorization": "100000.01"
  }
```

You can use this information to:

- Send proactive notifications (like emails) to customers before payments are due
- Check the status of a payment method before charging it
- Understand why a payment is not processing
